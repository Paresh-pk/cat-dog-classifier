This project demonstrates deploying a FastAPI demo application on Render for easy, scalable hosting. The app serves a simple API (or ML model) and is configured to run with Gunicorn + Uvicorn workers for production reliability. It supports environment variables, health-check endpoints, and secrets management for smooth cloud deployment. The repository includes a render.yaml for reproducible infrastructure, an optional start.sh script to load service account credentials, and guidance for connecting to remote MLflow servers or cloud storage (GCS/S3) for model artifacts. Perfect for showcasing machine learning demos or lightweight APIs with minimal setup and automatic redeploys.
